# User Flow with dropouts using D3 sankey in Angular 10

[![The MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

> This project is a demonstration of creating user flow chart with dropouts using [D3 sankey](https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey) in Angular 10


## Background
D3-sankey is an open-source charting library to visualize the directed flow between nodes in an acyclic network.

One key feature that I have implemented is ability to visalize user flows with dropout nodes (marked in red) integrated with Angular 10. Visit this [link](https://idris-rampurawala.github.io/ng-d3-sankey/) to see it in action!
